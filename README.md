Math 4250 Assignment 2

The files associated with this assignment have 
taken names describing what they pertain to.
Each file should run on its own by simply calling
it with python3.

In the previous assignment, I endeavoured to stick
rigorously to PEP8 standards along with an object
oriented implementation to promote data encapsulation.
This time, the focus is more on just having a file that
runs and does what it is supposed to in a reasonable
amount of time.

There is one exception.  For the final question, I have
included a function to permute the squares within the
Monte Carlo methods program.  It is currently commented
out in the state transition function.  Removing the comment
marker will allow the function to be called and implement
the permuting squares.
